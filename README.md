Fraud is a continuously on the rise as fraudsters are trying to game the system to steal customer's identity and use credit card with the intention of never paying the Bank back. Our goal is to recommend the best factors and model that help determine if credit card transaction is fraudulent

In the https://github.com/melvinhwong/Capstone-Two/blob/main/Data%20wrangling%20.ipynb, provides a high level analysis of credit card transactions from 1/1/2019 - 12/31/2020. Additionally, we perform some data cleaning to identify any blank fields and calculate the distance between the customer's home address with the merchant location. 

In https://github.com/melvinhwong/Capstone-Two/blob/main/Exploratory%20Data%20Analysis%20(EDA).ipynb, we identify the attributes and distribution of attributes as transactions are identified as fraud. 

In https://github.com/melvinhwong/Capstone-Two/blob/main/Modeling.ipynb, we instantiate the model train and test splits. 

In https://github.com/melvinhwong/Capstone-Two/blob/main/Pre-processing%20and%20Training%20Data%20Development.ipynb, we identify the models that best helps identify transactions as fraudulent.
